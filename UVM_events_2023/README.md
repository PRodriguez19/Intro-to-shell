Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise, necessitating the discovery of new antibiotic molecules. Bacteria are themselves are a valuable source of antibiotics. Threonyl tRNA synthetases (ThrRSs) catalyse the attachment of L-threonine to its cognate tRNA. These enzymes are essential for the translation of proteins and so are an excellent antibiotic targets. There are currently two known bacterial natural product ThrRS inhibitors, borrelidin and obafluorin, produced by the Gram-positive bacteria Streptomyces parvulus and the Gram-negative Pseudomonas fluorescens, respectively. Both of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encode secondary ThrRSs which provide self-resistance. In the borrelidin BGC, this is BorO and in the obafluorin BGC, this is ObaO. While the biosynthesis of both compounds is well understood, we continue to characterise the self-resistance proteins from both of these systems, and elucidate the mechanism of action by obafluorin on its target. An understanding of these self-resistance mechanisms allow us to search for similar putative self-resistance proteins in nature, allowing us to identify novel ThrRS inhibitors.
