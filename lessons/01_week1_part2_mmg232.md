## Instructions on installing FileZilla: An FTP Client Software
FileZilla is a widely used FTP client that is free and open source. This will allow you to securely transfer files from your local desktop onto a server (for us its the VACC). 

This is a *temporary fix* until the permissions are changed and I have access to securly transfer files into your VACC account. 

>*Before proceeding: if you are uncomfortable with downloading filezilla on your local desktop altogether, there is another way for us to go about this - but it requires me to individually put my password into your computer's so it can be time-consuming for each person but completely doable.*

Please download FileZilla Client using this [link](https://filezilla-project.org/)  
This is a really nice step-by-step [6-min youtube video](https://youtu.be/adxmlHDim6c) that will show you how to download FileZilla Client onto your laptop. 

Around the 2-min timepoint of the video, it states to "Click on File and then select Site Manager". 
To configure your site manager, you will need to create a new site called "VACC".

Below is an image of how my site manager looks like. 
>No Port was indicated, I also did not change the transfer settings. 
>Once you've entered all the information as shown, click Connect. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Around the 3:32-min timepoint of the video, it says "...you should now be connected to your server and be ready to transfer files.." 

The dataset you will need to download onto your local desktop is: 
[Introduction to Shell: Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3lkyz1pz021222/unix_lesson.tar.gz?dl=1)  
**I suggest moving the dataset from your Downloads folder to your Desktop.**

Now, using Filezilla - transfer the dataset folder you just downloaded into your VACC account. If you feel uncomfortable doing this, no worries, we will go over these steps tomorrow in class. 

Again, this is a temporary fix. I am waiting to chat with the folks at the VACC so we can avoid this in the future. Thank you for bearing with me! 

Notice the file you downloaded has the file ending of .tar.gz which means that this is a compressed file that needs to be decompressed to view the contents. 

To decompress the folder type the following command: 
```
tar -xvzf unix_lesson.tar.gz
```

## scp 
```
scp â€“r 
pdrodrig@vacc-user1.uvm.edu:/users/p/d/pdrodrig/vacc-ondemand/data/unix_lesson . 
```

## Learning Objectives for Today's Lesson
-  Understand the organization of the Filesystem 
-  Distinguish between Full versus Relative paths
-  listing, copying, creating, moving and removing data

## Listing contents of data folder 

Now let's look at what is inside `unix_lesson`. We are use to clicking on a folder name to open it, however, now we are forced to change our mindset and open a folder or "directory" differently within the shell environment. 

To look inside the `unix_lesson` directory, we need to change which directory we are *in*. To do this we can use the `cd` command, which stands for "change directory". 

```bash
cd unix_lesson
```

Notice the change in your command prompt. The "~" symbol from before should have been replaced by the string `unix_lesson`. This means that our `cd` command ran successfully and we are now *in* the new directory. Let's see what's inside by listing the contents:

```bash
ls
```

You should see:

```
genomics_data  other  raw_fastq  README.txt  reference_data
```
Notice that `ls` has printed the name of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns. 

### Arguments

There are five items listed when you run `ls`, but how do you know if these are files or folders with more files inside of it? 

To answer this question, we can modify the default behavior of `ls` by adding an **"argument"** to get more information. 

```bash
ls -F
```

```
genomics_data/  other/  raw_fastq/  README.txt  reference_data/
```

Anything with a "/" after its name is a directory. Things with an asterisk "*" after them are programs.  If there are no "decorations" after the name, it's a normal text file.


### How to get more information about Arguments
Most commands will take additional arguments that control their behavior. How do we know what arguments are available for a particular command? The most commonly used shell commands have a manual available that can be accessed using the `man` command. Let's try this command with `ls`:

```bash
man ls
```

This will open the manual page for `ls` and you will lose the command prompt. It will bring you to a so-called "buffer" page, a page you can navigate with your mouse or if you want to use your keyboard we have listed some basic key strokes:
* 'spacebar' to go forward 
* 'b' to go backward
* Up or down arrows to go forward or backward, respectively

**To get out of the `man` "buffer" page and to be able to type commands again on the command prompt, press the `q` key!**

# Navigating the Filesystem
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. 

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/directory_structure.png" width="600">
</p>

+ The first directory in the filesystem is the **root directory**. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem. That `/` or root is the 'top' level.
+ Each parent directory contains child directories and/or files. 
+ Each child directory can also contain more files

> Note: When you log in to a remote computer you land on one of the branches of that tree, i.e. your pre-designated "home" directory that usually has your login name as its name (e.g. `/users/username`).

To navigate the file system with ease we will now introduce the concept of **tab completion**. 

## Shortcut: Tab Completion 
<kbd>tab</kbd>    
<kbd>caps lock</kbd>

Typing out file or directory names can waste a lot of time and its easy to make typing mistakes. Instead we should get in the habit of using tab complete as a shortcut. The `tab` key is located on the left side of your keyboard, right above the `caps lock` key. When you start typing out the first few characters of a directory name, then hit the `tab` key, Shell will try to fill in the rest of the directory name. Let's put this into practice now. 

Navigate into the `raw_fastq` directory and see what's inside. **Remember to use tab!**

```bash
$ cd raw_fastq/
```

Question: Where is `raw_fastq` in relation to our home directory?

## Paths
To answer this, let's learn more about the "addresses" of directories, called **"path"** and move around the file system.

Let's check to see what directory we currently are in. The command prompt tells us which directory we are in, but it doesn't give information about where the `raw_fastq` directory is with respect to our "home" directory or the `/` directory.

The command to check our current location is `pwd`, this command does not take any arguments and it returns the path or address of your **p**resent **w**orking **d**irectory (the folder you are in currently).

```bash
$ pwd
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/pwd.png" width="600">
</p>

In the output above, each folder is separated from its "parent" or "child" folder by a "/", and the output starts with the root `/` directory. So, now you are able to determine the location of `raw_fastq` directory relative to the root directory. 

But what if you would like to navigate back to your home directory? No worries, just type `cd` and this will bring you back to your home directory. 

```bash
$ cd
```

After doing this what is your present working directory now?

```bash
$ pwd
```

It should look something like this: 
```
/users/p/d/pdrodrig
```

This should display a shorter string of directories starting with root. This is the full address to your home directory, also referred to as "**full path**". The "full" here refers to the fact that the path starts with the root, which means you know which branch of the tree you are on in reference to the root.


### Using paths with commands

You can do a lot more with the idea of stringing together *parent/child* directories. Let's say we want to look at the contents of the `raw_fastq` folder, but do it from our current directory (the home directory). We can use the list command and follow it up with the path to the folder we want to list!

```bash
$ cd

$ ls ~/unix_lesson/raw_fastq
```

```
Irrel_kd_1.subset.fq	Irrel_kd_3.subset.fq	Mov10_oe_2.subset.fq
Irrel_kd_2.subset.fq	Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq	Mov10_oe_3.subset.fq
```

Now, what if we wanted to change directories from `~` (home) to `raw_fastq` in a single step? 

```bash
$ cd ~/unix_lesson/raw_fastq
```
> Note: You can always copy-and-paste commands, but I do suggest typing it yourself to practice. 

Good job, you have moved 2 levels of directories with one command! 

Now, what if we want to move back up a level back into the `unix_lesson` directory?   
Type `cd unix_lesson` and see what happens.

*Unfortunately, that won't work because when you say `cd unix_lesson`, shell is looking for a folder called `unix_lesson` within your current directory, i.e. `raw_fastq`.*

Can you think of an alternative? 

+ You can use the full path to `unix_lesson`
+ You can do cd .. (allows you to move one folder up)

```bash
$ cd .. 
```

### File Names 
Probably one of the most frustrating parts of bioinformatics is the lack of consistency with how files are labeled. Files often have obscure names that is only relevant to the researcher, or have names that are **very** similar to one another. But nonetheless we will continue! 

Let's go into the `raw_fastq`, then type `ls Mov10_oe_`, followed by pressing the `tab` key once:

```bash
$ cd raw_fastq/
$ ls Mov10_oe_<tab>
```

**Notice that nothing happens!!**

The reason is there are multiple files in the `raw_fastq` directory that start with `Mov10_oe_`. As a result, shell does not know which one to fill in. When you hit `tab` a second time again, the shell will then list all the possible choices.

```bash
$ ls Mov10_oe_<tab><tab>

$ Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq  Mov10_oe_2.subset.fq  Mov10_oe_3.subset.fq
```


Now you can select the one you are interested in listed, and enter the number and hit tab again to fill in the complete name of the file.

```bash
$ ls Mov10_oe_1<tab>
```

> **NOTE:** Tab completion can also fill in the names of commands. For example, enter `e<tab><tab>`. You will see the name of every command that starts with an `e`. One of those is `echo`. If you enter `ech<tab>`, you will see that tab completion works. 

**Tab completion is your friend!** It helps prevent spelling mistakes, and speeds up the process of typing in the full command. We encourage you to use this when working on the command line. 

## Relative paths

We have talked about **full** paths so far, but there are other ways to specify paths to folders and files without having to worry about the root directory. 

Let's change directories back to our home directory, and once more change directories from `~` (home) to `raw_fastq` in a single step. (*Feel free to use your tab-completion to complete your path!*)

```bash
$ cd
$ cd unix_lesson/raw_fastq
```

This time we are not using the `~/` before `unix_lesson`. In this case we are using a relative path, relative to our current location - wherein we know that `unix_lesson` is a child folder in our home folder, and the `raw_fastq` folder is within `unix_lesson`.

> Previously we had used the following:
> ```bash
> $ cd ~/unix_lesson/raw_fastq
> ```

Remember there is also a handy shortcut for the relative path to a parent directory, 2 periods `..`. Let's say we wanted to move from the `raw_fastq` folder to its parent folder.

```bash
cd ..
```

You should now be in the `unix_lesson` directory (check command prompt or run `pwd`).

> You will be learning a little more about the `..` shortcut later. Can you think of an example when this shortcut to the parent directory won't work?

## Synopsis of Full versus Relative paths

**A full path always starts with a `/`, a relative path does not.**

A relative path is like getting directions from someone on the street. They tell you to "go right at the Stop sign, and then turn left on Main Street". That works great if you're standing there together, but not so well if you're trying to tell someone how to get there from another country. A full path is like GPS coordinates. It tells you exactly where something is no matter where you are right now.

You can usually use either a full path or a relative path depending on what is most convenient. If we are in the home directory, it is more convenient to just enter the relative path since it involves less typing. However, when using some programs, full paths are required. 

### Example using Full Paths:   
It can get really complex, real fast!  

```
samtools merge /users/p/d/pdrodrig/software/bin/samtools merge WT_Ikaros_rep2_merged.bam /gpfs2/scratch/jrboyd/pipelines/cutruntools/output_mm10_cutnrun_bcell_stim_032621/aligned.aug10/sorted/WTU_Ikaros_H100_rep1_2_S23_L002_aligned_reads.bam /users/p/d/pdrodrig/cutnrun_bcell/unmerged_bams/WT_H100_IK_rep1.IK2_S2_L001_aligned_reads.bam;
```
> Lets break this down! 

+ Program + argument = samtools merge  
+ New file name = merge WT_Ikaros_rep2_merged.bam 
+ 1st file = WTU_Ikaros_H100_rep1_2_S23_L002_aligned_reads.bam
+ 2nd file = WT_H100_IK_rep1.IK2_S2_L001_aligned_reads.bam


Over time, it will become easier for you to keep a mental note of the structure of the directories that you are using and how to quickly navigate among them.

# Copying, creating, moving and removing data

Now we can move around within the directory structure using the command line. But what if we want to do things like copy files or move them from one directory to another, or rename them? 

Let's move into the `raw_fastq` directory, this contains some fastq files which are the output of sequencing. 

```bash
cd ~/unix_lesson/raw_fastq
```

> **Tip** - These files are referred to as "raw" data since it has not been changed or analyzed after being generated.

## Copying

Let's use the copy (`cp`) command to make a copy of one of the files in this folder, `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq`, and call the copied file `Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq`. 
The copy command has the following syntax: 

`cp  path/to/item-being-copied  path/to/new-copied-item`

In this case the files are in our current directory, so we just have to specify the name of the file being copied, followed by whatever we want to call the newly copied file.

```bash
$ cp Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq

$ ls -l
```

The copy command can also be used for copying over whole directories, but the `-r` argument has to be added after the `cp` command. The `-r` stands for "recursively copy everything from the directory and its sub-directories". We used it earlier when we copied over the `unix_lesson` directory to our home directories.

## Creating

Next, let's create a directory called `fastq_backup` and we can move the copy of the fastq file into that directory. 

The `mkdir` command is used to make a directory, syntax: `mkdir  name-of-folder-to-be-created`.

```bash
$ mkdir fastq_backup
```

> **Tip** - File/directory/program names with spaces in them do not work well in Unix, use characters like hyphens or underscores instead. Using underscores instead of spaces is called "snake_case". Alternatively, some people choose to skip spaces and rather just capitalize the first letter of each new word (i.e. MyNewFile). This alternative technique is called "CamelCase".

## Moving

We can now move our copied fastq file in to the new directory. We can move files around using the move command, `mv`, syntax: 

`mv  path/to/item-being-moved  path/to/destination` 

In this case we can use relative paths and just type the name of the file and folder.

```bash
$ mv  Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq  fastq_backup
```

Let's check if the move command worked like we wanted:

```bash
$ ls -l fastq_backup
```

## Renaming

The `mv` command has a second functionality, it is what you would use to rename files too. The syntax is identical to when we used `mv` for moving, but this time instead of giving a directory as its destination, we just give a new name as its destination. 

Let's try out this functionality!

The name Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq is not very informative, we want to make sure that we have the word "backup" in it so we don't accidentally delete it.

```bash
$ cd fastq_backup

$ mv  Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq   Mov10_oe_1.subset-backup.fq

$ ls
```

> **Tip** - You can use move to move a file and rename it at the same time!

**Important notes about `mv`**:
* When using `mv`, shell will **not** ask if you are sure that you want to "replace existing file" or similar unless you use the -i option. 
* Once replaced, it is not possible to get the replaced file back!

## Removing

We found out that we did not need to create backups of our fastq files manually as backups were already generated by our collaborator. So in the interest of saving space on the cluster, we want to delete the contents of the `fastq-backup` folder and the folder itself. 

```bash
$ rm  Mov10_oe_1.subset-backup.fq
```

Important notes about `rm`
* `rm` permanently removes/deletes the file/folder. 
* There is no concept of "Trash" or "Recycle Bin" on the command-line. When you use `rm` to remove/delete they're really gone. 
* **Be careful with this command!**
* You can use the `-i` argument if you want it to ask before removing, `rm -i file-name`.

Let's delete the fastq_backup folder too. First, we'll have to navigate our way to the parent directory (we can't delete the folder we are currently in/using). 

```bash
$ cd ..

$ rm  fastq_backup 
```

Did that work? Did you get an error?

<details>
  <summary><i>Explanation</i></summary>
  <P>By default, <code>rm</code>, will NOT delete directories, but you use the <code>-r</code> flag if you are sure that you want to delete the directories and everything within them. To be safe, let's use it with the <code>-i</code> flag.</P>
</details><br>

```bash
$ rm -ri fastq_backup
```

- `-r`: recursive, commonly used as an option when working with directories, e.g. with `cp`. 
- `-i`: prompt before every removal.

## Homework Assignment #1 & 2 (40 points)
**For this assignment you will have until 11:59PM on Monday, January 23rd to submit. Late assignments will not be accepted.**  

### Directions for Students: 
Open a new Microsoft Word Document, the first four lines of your document should contain the following:  
+ Your name
+ MMG232
+ Today's date
+ Homework Assignment # 1 & 2
 

### Task 1: 
* On Terminal, open the manual page for the `cp` command. Skim through the information. 
  
1)  What does the -u option stand for and what does it do?   
2)  Which option would you use to explain what is being done (i.e. verbose)?   
    
* Quit the `man` buffer page and come back to your command prompt.  

> **Tip** - Shell commands can get extremely complicated. No one can possibly learn all of these arguments, of course. So you will probably find yourself referring to the manual page frequently.

> **Tip** - If the manual page within the Terminal is hard to read , the manual exists online too. For example, here is the linux manual page for `cp`. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html In addition to the arguments, you can also find good examples online; ***Google is your friend.***


### Task 2: 
* Use the `-l` option for the `ls` command to display more information for each item in the `unix_lesson` folder. 
 
3) Submit a screenshot of your terminal screen and underneath describe what additional information is provided that you didn't see with the bare `ls` command. 


**For #4-6, submit a screenshot of your terminal screen. Be sure to clear your terminal screen using <button>control</button> + L before proceeding**  

4) Create a new folder in `unix_lesson` called `selected_fastq`  
5) Copy over the Irrel_kd_2.subset.fq and Mov10_oe_2.subset.fq from `raw_fastq` to the `selected_fastq` folder  
6) Rename the `selected_fastq` folder and call it `exercise1`
